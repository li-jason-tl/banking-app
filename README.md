## Banking-App

## Context
Many beginners struggle to build a real-world financial system that includes user authentication,
transaction history, and account tracking in a secure and scalable way.

### Goal
I wanted to create a simple but functional banking application to demonstrate core backend skills
using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework.


### Action

- Designed a relational schema in **SQL Server** to manage users, accounts, and transactions.​

- Implemented user registration and login features using ASP.NET Identity.​

- Created modules to view and create transactions, and track account balances.

### Tools Used
- ASP.NET Core, EF Core, SQL Server​

- Visual Studio, GitHub

### Result
- Successfully demonstrated full-stack development using Microsoft technologies.​

- Improved skills in backend architecture, database migrations, and identity management.​

- The project shows my ability to build secure and scalable financial applications.​

- It’s published on my GitHub with clear documentation for others to use or extend
